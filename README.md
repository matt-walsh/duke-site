# Option #3 – Local Band Website
You’ve been hired by a local band to create a single-page website for them. They forgot to tell you the band name and what kind of music they play. You’ll just have to guess! They have the following requirements:
- A custom logo for the band
- A section that shows 12 upcoming tour dates including:
    - The venue name where the show will be held
    - The date of the show
    - If the show is all ages or 18+
    - The price of a ticket for the show
- A profile section for the band. Each member of the band (it’s a 4-person band). It should include:
    - The name of the member
    - What instrument they play
    - A brief profile about themselves and how they joined the band
    - A photo of the band member
- A dedicated footer section with contact info on how you can contact their band manager to book shows and links to their social media accounts.
